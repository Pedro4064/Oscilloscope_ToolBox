To be implemented:
	[X] Add Channel data method
	[X] Default channel names - Using the Source metadata
	[] README.md

Check if possible:
	[] If it would be possible, with the oscilloscope's metadata and readings to calculate and plot FFT of each channel
	[] Add a "Pivot" Table with most important properties
	[] Calculate properties like:
		- Amplitude
		- Peak to Peak Voltage
		- Frequency
		- Phase between channels 
		- Rise Time
		- Fall Time
